This site documents the technical standards and guidance that we expect teams working
within the [Department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education)
to follow when building digital services.

It complements the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and its
[Technology section](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology),
which covers service design more broadly.

It is inspired by the [GDS Way](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital) and the
[Ministry of Justice Technical Guidance](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/#moj-technical-guidance).
